[00:00.024] But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
[00:02.854] I asked her where it goes, 'cause I really want
[00:05.596] I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
[00:08.639] That's the way it goes in this city wonder (City wonder, city wonder)
[00:12.802]

[00:29.479] New gold, fool's gold
[00:32.347] Everythin' will disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[00:37.125] Someone's out here
[00:39.705] Who traveled far too many years (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[00:44.541] Nowhere, nowhere
[00:47.123] Nothin' here is ever real (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[00:52.157] New gold, fool's gold
[00:54.942] Everythin' will disappear, disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[00:59.749] (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[01:02.521] (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[01:05.384] (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
[01:08.226] (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[02:15.344] Desolate city where it hurts to smile
[02:17.164] Ran into the Reverend, says it's been a while
[02:18.873] I'm reining in a rando, she's a social scandal
[02:20.930] Ran into the Reverend, says it's been a while
[02:22.842] I'm, moved to the spot, I'm one of a few
[02:24.645] A whole lot of everything, but nothin' to do
